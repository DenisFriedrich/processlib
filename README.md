A workflow/process library for python. WIP

How to display relevant fields from the process model in templates?
Do we have custom templates for certain process models / flows?

How do we handle assignments and permissions?
Who is allowed to undo/cancel tasks?
E.g. the transmit-to-einfachpacken-background-job should not be cancelable by a random user

What happens when we undo a background task that was started automatically?
